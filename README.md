# Customizable_Interface_Demo

This is a repo for my work basied on this tutorial: https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/reactjs-implement-drag-and-drop-feature-without-using-external-libraries-ad8994429f1a/

Notes: 
Installed NPM in VS Code. *(Installed Node because it wasn't installed on this machine)

I have found that the powershell command Remove-Item C:\Users\Duck\Customizable_Interface_Demi\app-drag-drop-demo is
usesful to remove large numbers of file. https://community.spiceworks.com/topic/2116434-best-and-fast-way-to-massive-permanently-delete

The current version of node does not permit capitals in file names.


Issues: 
create-react-app not funtioning as intended.
I have attempted, 
    npm rm -g create-react-app
    npm install -g create-react-app
    npx create-react-app my-app
